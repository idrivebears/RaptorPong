RaptorPong
==========

Simple(and buggy) Pong game made in Raptor

I used Raptor first semester in my Intro to Programming class, I found the program in some dark corner of my computer today,
so I decided to do this micro-project just to see if I could do something mildly fun with this (very) restricted platform. Enjoy!
